            <img src="Images/OurStory.jpg" alt="Brew Bliss Cafe Story" class="about-image">
            <p>Founded in 2020, Brew Bliss Cafe began as a dream to create more than just a coffee shop – we wanted to create a haven where people could find their perfect blend of comfort, community, and exceptional coffee.
